    "\n",
    "1. EXTRACT PROTOCOL INFORMATION:\n",
    "- Only include titles, objectives, or descriptions that are explicitly shown or stated in the video\n",

    "- Document ALL significant events chronologically with precise timestamps\n",
    "- Include: volume setting changes, pipette handling, liquid transfers, tip changes, errors, corrections\n",
    "- Mark whether each event is pipette-related (aspirate/dispense) or not\n",
    "- Capture the complete narrative of what happens in the video\n",
    "- Include failed attempts, practice runs, and error corrections as separate events\n",
    "\n",
    "3. PIPETTE OPERATIONS (SUBSET OF FRAME EVENTS):\n",
    "- Extract only the aspirate/dispense operations from your frame-by-frame analysis\n",
    "- Each operation should correspond to an event you already documented\n",
    "- Record exact timestamps for EVERY aspirate/dispense action\n",
    "- Track complete sequences: aspirate → dispense pairs\n",
    "- Include successful operations, failed attempts, error corrections, and practice runs\n",
    "- Only identify containers that are clearly visible and distinguishable\n",
    "- Only record volume amounts that are explicitly shown on pipette displays\n",
    "- Note warnings for issues that are visibly demonstrated (air bubbles, incorrect technique)\n",
    "\n",
    "VALIDATION:\n",
    "- Every pipette operation timestamp must match a pipette-related event in your frame analysis\n",
    "- Every timestamp must correspond to a clearly visible action\n",
