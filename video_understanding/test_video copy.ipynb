      "{\"thinking\":\"The user wants me to analyze the entire video to understand the experimental procedure. The video begins with the user showing a notebook which contains the experimental plan. The plan is laid out in a grid format, corresponding to wells A1, A2, and A3. Well A1 is planned to contain '30A, 30B', well A2 '30A, 30C', and well A3 '30B, 30C'. I will assume A, B, and C are distinct reagents and the numbers refer to volumes in microliters (uL). At timestamp 0:07, the user sets a pipette to '030', which on this type of pipette corresponds to 30.0 uL, confirming the volumes from the notebook. The user then proceeds to execute this plan by pipetting liquids between microcentrifuge tubes in a rack. The procedure is as follows: 1. A new tip is used. 30uL of what I'm designating 'Reagent A' is aspirated from a source tube and dispensed into two separate empty destination tubes (which will become the A1 and A2 mixtures). The tip is discarded. 2. A new tip is used. 30uL of 'Reagent B' is aspirated. It's first dispensed into the first destination tube (completing the A1 mixture: A+B) and then into a third empty destination tube (as the first component of the A3 mixture). The tip is discarded. 3. A new tip is used. 30uL of 'Reagent C' is aspirated. It's first dispensed into the second destination tube (completing the A2 mixture: A+C) and then into the third destination tube (completing the A3 mixture: B+C). The tip is discarded. The final result is three tubes containing the mixtures as specified in the notebook. I am mapping these destination tubes to the well IDs A1, A2, and A3 from the experimental plan.\",\"timestamp_range\":\"0:00-1:12\",\"goal_wells\":[{\"well_id\":\"A1\",\"reagents\":[{\"name\":\"Reagent A\",\"volume_ul\":30.0},{\"name\":\"Reagent B\",\"volume_ul\":30.0}]},{\"well_id\":\"A2\",\"reagents\":[{\"name\":\"Reagent A\",\"volume_ul\":30.0},{\"name\":\"Reagent C\",\"volume_ul\":30.0}]},{\"well_id\":\"A3\",\"reagents\":[{\"name\":\"Reagent B\",\"volume_ul\":30.0},{\"name\":\"Reagent C\",\"volume_ul\":30.0}]}],\"reagent_sources\":[\"Reagent A\",\"Reagent B\",\"Reagent C\"]}\n"
