  "thinking": "I will systematically analyze the video to identify all volume setting changes, aspirations, dispensings, and tip changes. The provided procedure context specifies that three reagents (A, B, C) are pipetted in 30 µL volumes into a 96-well plate according to a plan shown in a notebook. I will use this context to infer the identity of the reagents, as the first two are clear liquids and the third is blue. The pipette volume is set once at the beginning to 30 µL and remains unchanged. I will identify each action, such as attaching a tip, aspirating from a source tube/cup, dispensing into a specific well, and ejecting the tip, providing a precise timestamp range for each event.",
