{"thinking":"The user wants me to analyze the entire video to determine the goal state of the experiment. At the beginning of the video (0:01-0:02), the user displays a notebook with a hand-drawn table. The table specifies the contents for wells A1, A2, and A3. The column headers are '1', '2', '3' and the row header is 'A'. A note at the top 'you' likely indicates the unit is microliters (uL). I will transcribe the contents of this table to define the goal for each well. Cell A1 contains '30uL A, 30uL B'. Cell A2 contains '30uL A, 30uL C'. Cell A3 contains '30uL B, 30uL C'. The video then shows the execution of this plan. The pipette is set to 30uL (0:08). Reagent A is pipetted into wells A1 and A2. A new tip is used. Reagent B is pipetted into wells A1 and A3. A new tip is used. Reagent C is pipetted into wells A2 and A3. This execution perfectly matches the plan laid out in the notebook. Therefore, the goal state is derived directly from the notebook.","timestamp_range":"0:00 - 1:12","goal_wells":[{"well_id":"A1","reagents":[{"name":"A","volume_ul":30.0},{"name":"B","volume_ul":30.0}]},{"well_id":"A2","reagents":[{"name":"A","volume_ul":30.0},{"name":"C","volume_ul":30.0}]},{"well_id":"A3","reagents":[{"name":"B","volume_ul":30.0},{"name":"C","volume_ul":30.0}]}],"reagent_sources":["A","B","C"]}
