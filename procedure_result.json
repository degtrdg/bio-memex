  "thinking": "The user wants me to extract the experimental procedure from the video. The primary source of information is the notebook shown at the beginning (0:01-0:03). The notebook outlines a plan for mixing three reagents in a 96-well plate. I will transcribe the contents of the notebook to determine the goal state for each well. The notebook grid specifies wells A1, A2, and A3. For A1, it lists '30µL A' and '30 B'. For A2, it lists '30µL A' and '30 C'. For A3, it lists '30 B' and '30 C'. I interpret 'A', 'B', and 'C' as distinct reagents. The volume is consistently 30µL for each component. The pipetting actions observed in the rest of the video confirm this plan. The pipette is set to '030', corresponding to 30µL (0:07). The operator then proceeds to pipette liquids into wells A1, A2, and A3, adding two components to each well, which aligns with the notebook's instructions. Therefore, the goal is to create pairwise mixtures of three reagents.",
