# Enhanced Lab Video Analysis Models

## Overview

I've designed comprehensive Pydantic models for your lab video analysis system that enable sophisticated tracking of pipetting operations with "needle in the haystack" query capabilities. These models are optimized for processing entire videos and providing real-time HUD overlay data.

## Key Features

### üéØ Complete State Tracking
- **Pipette State**: Volume settings, reagent tracking, tip contamination history
- **Reagent Transfers**: Detailed transfer tracking with volume accuracy metrics
- **Well Contents**: Cumulative reagent tracking with completion status
- **Contamination Warnings**: Cross-contamination detection and risk assessment
- **Volume Discrepancies**: Precise volume tracking and discrepancy analysis

### üîç "Needle in the Haystack" Queries
- Find all contamination events above a severity threshold
- Trace cross-contamination chains across reagents
- Identify when tip changes should have occurred
- Analyze pipetting accuracy across entire experiments
- Find protocol deviations and incomplete wells

### üì∫ HUD Overlay Support
- Real-time experiment status
- Current pipette state and reagent
- Active warnings and contamination risk
- Completion percentage and progress metrics

## New Model Classes

### Core Models

#### `PipetteState`
Complete pipette tracking including:
- Volume settings and actual aspirated volumes
- Last reagent aspirated and source container
- Tip contamination level and history
- Current position and last action
- Performance accuracy metrics

#### `ReagentTransfer`
Detailed transfer tracking with:
- Source and destination containers
- Intended vs actual volumes
- Pipette state during transfer
- Quality metrics and observed issues
- Transfer accuracy scoring

#### `ContaminationWarning`
Comprehensive contamination alerts:
- Warning type and severity levels
- Contamination source and affected containers
- Risk probability and impact assessment
- Recommended corrective actions

#### `VolumeDiscrepancy`
Volume tracking and analysis:
- Expected vs observed volumes
- Absolute and relative differences
- Possible causes and suggested actions
- Severity assessment

#### `WellContents`
Enhanced well tracking:
- Current reagents and total volume
- Complete transfer history
- Contamination risk assessment
- Visual properties (color, homogeneity)
- Completion status checking

#### `ExperimentState`
Complete experiment management:
- Equipment and container states
- Goal tracking and protocol steps
- Event history (transfers, warnings, discrepancies)
- Progress and quality metrics
- HUD data generation

### Enums for Type Safety
- `PipetteAction`: aspirate, dispense, mix, blow_out, touch_tip, change_tip, idle
- `ContaminationLevel`: clean, potentially_contaminated, contaminated, unknown
- `WarningType`: cross_contamination, volume_discrepancy, technique_error, etc.
- `WarningSeverity`: low, medium, high, critical

## Integration with Existing Workflow

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing `VideoAnalysis`, `Well`, and `Reagent` models are preserved
- New enhanced tracking is additive, not replacing existing functionality
- Legacy triggered flags continue to work as before

### Enhanced VideoAnalysis
The `VideoAnalysis` model now includes:
```python
# New enhanced tracking
experiment_state_updated: bool
experiment_state: Optional[ExperimentState]

# Specific event detection
transfers_detected: List[ReagentTransfer]
contamination_warnings_detected: List[ContaminationWarning]
volume_discrepancies_detected: List[VolumeDiscrepancy]

# Pipette state changes
pipette_state_changed: bool
new_pipette_state: Optional[PipetteState]

# Frame analysis metadata
frame_range: Optional[str]
analysis_confidence: Optional[float]
key_events_detected: List[str]
```

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage
```python
# Create experiment
experiment = ExperimentState(experiment_id="EXP-001", total_wells=6)

# Track reagent transfer
transfer = ReagentTransfer(
    transfer_id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
    reagent=Reagent(name="Buffer A", volume_ul=30.0),
    source_container="TUBE-A",
    destination_well="A1",
    intended_volume_ul=30.0,
    actual_volume_ul=29.5,
    pipette_volume_setting=30.0
)
experiment.add_transfer(transfer)

# Get HUD data
hud_data = experiment.get_hud_summary()
```

### Advanced Queries
```python
analyzer = LabVideoAnalyzer(experiment)

# Find contamination events
contamination = analyzer.find_contamination_events(WarningSeverity.MEDIUM)

# Trace cross-contamination chains
chain = analyzer.find_cross_contamination_chain("Reagent A")

# Analyze pipetting accuracy
accuracy = analyzer.analyze_pipetting_accuracy()

# Find protocol deviations
deviations = analyzer.find_protocol_deviations()

# Generate comprehensive report
report = analyzer.generate_experiment_report()
```

### HUD Overlay Data
```python
hud_summary = experiment.get_hud_summary()
# Returns:
{
    "experiment_id": "EXP-001",
    "completion_percentage": 50.0,
    "wells_completed": "3/6",
    "pipette_volume": "30.0¬µl",
    "pipette_reagent": "Buffer A",
    "tip_status": "clean",
    "active_warnings": 2,
    "contamination_risk": "potentially_contaminated",
    "last_action": "dispense",
    "total_transfers": 15
}
```
